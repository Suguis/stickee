# Stickee

> [!NOTE]
> We are still working on the development of a minimal product. There is no release yet.

Stickee is a simple and ephemeral text storage application. It was designed to be easily hosted in a server directly as a Docker container or in a K8s cluster.

Some planned core features are:

- Self-destruct notes that are deleted from the database when opened
- Password protected notes that allow _at-rest_ and _in-transit_ encrypted notes, to store sensitive information
