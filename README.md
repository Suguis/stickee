Stickee is a simple and secure text storage application that allows you to post sensitive information and generate a temporary link to share it. Stickee focuses on security and is designed to be easily hosted on a private server, giving you control over your data.

## Try it

You use our **hosted Stickee instance** [here](https://stickee.siesta.cat), or deploy it yourself using the instructions below.

## Roadmap

As for now, the project has very basic features. Here's what's planned for future releases:
- [ ] Choose when a note will be deleted
- [ ] Self-destruct notes that are deleted from the database when opened
- [ ] Password protected notes that allow _at-rest_ and _in-transit_ encrypted notes, to store sensitive information
- [ ] Enhanced view with a fancy UI that shows details of the node, such as the time when the note will be deleted, syntax highlighting, etc.

## Deploying with Docker compose

You can read the details of how to pull the Docker image [here](https://github.com/Suguis/stickee/pkgs/container/stickee). Also, you can take a look to the [example docker compose file](https://github.com/Suguis/stickee/blob/main/example-compose.yaml).
